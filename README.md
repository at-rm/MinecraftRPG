# Minecraft RPG Plugin

This plugin allows players to **gain XP** by breaking and placing blocks, killing mobs, and enchanting items! The gained XP does not affect Minecraft's built-in XP system but stands on its own.

Players can then **upgrade their skills**, so that they become faster, have more health, are stronger, have increased XP gain and are more endurant!
